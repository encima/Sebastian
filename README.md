A C-based Client/Server for sending files, currently the server is set to save received as JPEGs (for my purpose),
obviously, feel free to change this as you wish.

Currently, the server is only listening for one file and then closing its stream, as I get more time to mess around with
this then that will change and it will just free up the buffer and close the file stream.

However, the more I work on this the more bespoke it may become. Just a heads up.
